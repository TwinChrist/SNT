For questions 1-4, assume that an array stores integers and has a maximum size of 100.  The array is used to store two distinct data structures, BOTH a queue and a stack.  The answer should be written in C or C++ and should not use any existing data structure libraries.

1.	Write a function that pushes an integer into the stack.


2.	Write a function that pops an integer from the stack.


3.	Write a function that enqueues an integer into the queue.

4.	Write a function that dequeues an integer from the queue. 

5.	For the given C function, below, please answer the 3 questions below:

int Function()
{
  int intArray[N];
  int arraySum = 0;
  for (int i = 0;i< N;i++)
  {
    intArray[i] = i;
    For(int J = 1;j<N;j++)
    {
      intArray[i] = J * intArray[i]   
    }
  }
  for(int k = 0; k < N; k++)
  {
    arraySum += intArray[k];
  }
  return arraySum;
}

a)	Give the  O(n) runtime complexity for the function. 

b)	Give an optimized version (if one exists) for the function.

c) Give the O(n) runtime complexity for the optimized version.
